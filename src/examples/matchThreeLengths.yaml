name: three equal lengths

  # Decides the language { aⁿbⁿcⁿ | n ≥ 0 }, that is,
  # accepts a's followed by b's then c's of the same length.
  input: aabbcc # try bac, aabc, aabcc, aabcbc
  blank: ' '
  # Cross off the first a, b, and c on each pass.
  # All a's must precede all b's, which must precede all c's.
  # When there are no more a's,
  # all input symbols should have been crossed off.

  # Exercises:

  # • Suppose a ledger starts from 0 and gains one dollar for each +
  #   and loses one for each -. Reading left to right,
  #   check that the account never goes into the negative.
  #   Examples: accept '+-++' and '++-+--', reject '-++' and '++---+'.

  # • Check parentheses for proper nesting,
  #   e.g. accept '()(()()())' but reject '(()))(' and '(()('.
