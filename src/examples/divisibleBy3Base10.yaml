name: divisible by 3 (base 10)
source code: |
  # Checks if a base 10 number is divisible by 3.
  input: 4728 # try 42, 57, 1337, 5328, 7521, 314159265
  blank: ' '
  # This uses the same idea as the base 2 version.
  #
  # To make things more interesting, we derive the step relation:
  # Let x be the number left of the tape head,
  #     d the digit under the head, and
  #     x' the number up to and including the head.
  # Then
  #   x' = 10x + d .
  # Notice 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Therefore
  #   x' ≡ x + d (mod 3) .
  # Each step simply adds the new digit's remainder mod 3.

  # • Check for divisibility by 5.
  #   Hint: only 2 states (besides accept) are required.

  # • Check for divisibility by 4.
  #   Hint: use 4 states (besides accept).
