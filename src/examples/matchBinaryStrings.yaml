  # Exercises:

  # • Accept if the second string is the bitwise complement
  #   (1s and 0s swapped) of the first, e.g. accept '1101#0010'.

  # • Check that a binary string has the same number of 0s and 1s;
  #   eg., accept '001110' but reject '10010'.

  # • Check if two strings are different.
  #   Example: accept '00#001' and '0101#0111', but reject '1001#1001'.
